## Instructions
Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

## Creating a database
First I created a database with my favorite tourist places in Iceland in Excel with the gps in columns named "lat" and "lng" with the name of the place in popop.

Then I loaded the data into R and named it "mapping".

```{r}
library(leaflet)
My_mapping <- read.csv("~/R/product making/mapping.csv")
head(My_mapping)
TouristIcon <- makeIcon(
        iconUrl = "https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/236/236998.svg",
        iconWidth = 31*215/230, iconHeight = 31,
        iconAnchorX = 31*215/230/2, iconAnchorY = 16
)

my_map <- leaflet() %>%
        addTiles() %>% 
        addMarkers(lat= My_mapping$Lat, lng= My_mapping$lng, popup=My_mapping$popup, icon = TouristIcon)
my_map
```
